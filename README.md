## Quick Start

### Server Setup (Required)
This application requires a server to handle API requests securely. The OpenAI API key is configured server-side only.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   # Production
   npm start
   
   # Development (with auto-restart)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the App**:
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and start generating images!

### Production Deployment
1. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key
   export NODE_ENV=production
   export PORT=3000
   ```

2. **Use a process manager** (PM2 recommended):
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name imagegen-pro
   ```

3. **Set up reverse proxy** (nginx example):
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
       }
   }
   ```

## Configuration

### OpenAI API Key (Server-Side Only)
1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   ```
3. Restart the server

**Security**: The API key is never exposed to the client. All API requests are proxied through the server.

### Advanced Settings
- **Output Format**: Choose between PNG (best quality), JPEG (smaller files), or WebP (modern format)
- **Compression Level**: Adjust compression for JPEG/WebP (0-100%)
- **Transparent Background**: Enable for PNG/WebP formats
- **Streaming Options**: Control number of partial images during generation

## Usage Guide

### Basic Image Generation
1. Select "Generate New Image" mode
2. Enter a detailed description of your desired image
3. Optionally adjust size and quality settings
4. Click "Generate Image"
5. Wait for the image to generate (with streaming enabled, you'll see partial previews)

### Image Editing
1. Select "Edit Existing Image" mode
2. Upload an image by clicking or dragging into the upload area
3. Describe how you want to edit the image
4. Click "Edit Image"

### Multi-turn Editing
